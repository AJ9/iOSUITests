# iOSUITests

## 5

I have removed the accessibility ID's from the storyboard, and added a view programatically. 
Your task is to add these back in, and write the UI tests for them.

- Set the ID's in the storyboard for all elements
- Set the ID for the programatically generated view
- Create a UI test file
- Create the UI tests
